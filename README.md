# Automatic-Gaze-Estimation
Computer Vision project

Gaze estimation is a very useful technique because it can improve the lives of users with disabilities enabling their interaction with computers. In recent years, these technologies have become widely used in both research and commercial applications.
However, this task is still being studied due to the presence of several challenging difficulties. In partic- ular, the main problems deal with the low quality of sensors or unknown/challenging environments, the large variations in eye region appearance and in images and videos with lower number of pixels, motion blur, less ideal illumination conditions and ambiguity in determining the extent of the eyeball or shape of the iris.
My approach to solve the gaze estimation problem is based on colors, i.e., in one eye there will be a relatively dark colored component composed by iris and pupil and a white component which is the sclera. The solution is provided by a histogram which detects the relative position of both iris and sclera inside the eye in consideration.
